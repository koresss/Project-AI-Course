Questions about data:
	- Data is univariate. Is that okay?
	- Should we use synthetic data to simulate intermittent forecast? (Nothing done so far seems to really look THAT intermittent)
	- Data points might not be enough -> get more? data augmentation?
	- Is it possible to do crossvalidation?

Questions about croston:
	- forecast = a/p. What to do when p=0? Should a and p be initialized with 0?
	- does croston just predict the average on the val set?

Questions about gbm:
	-  Currently using gbm to do pointwise regression, only 1 feature = day num.
