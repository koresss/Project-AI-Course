For MASE always scale by in-sample prediction of naive forecast? (aka even for validation set?) Scale by naive val and naive test respectively

Questions about data:
	- Data is univariate. Is that okay?
	- Should we use synthetic data to simulate intermittent forecast? (Nothing done so far seems to really look THAT intermittent) -> good idea to compare models for their sensitivity to infrequency (just an idea)
	- Data points might not be enough -> get more? data augmentation?

Questions about croston:
	- forecast = a/p. What to do when p=0? Should a and p be initialized with 0? => cold start problem in exponential smoothing
	- Does croston just predict the average on the val set? yes

Questions about gbm:
	-  Currently using gbm to do pointwise regression, only 1 feature = day num.

Move to multivariate case -> add more time indexes (year, quarter, month, month of year, day of week etc.) encode as cyclical features (using sine and cosine)



Questions saturday:
	- For 1 step ahead prediction, should we do rolling prediction?
